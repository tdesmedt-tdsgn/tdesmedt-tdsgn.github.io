## Setting up data science

### Introduction
Implementing data science within corporate environments presents a complex challenge. Many organizations struggle or fail to effectively incorporate data science, resulting in suboptimal infrastructures that hinder the potential positive impact of data science on their operations. This document will discuss various risks and setup models associated with incorporating data science in corporate settings.

Data science and scientific modeling can address business problems in innovative and efficient ways, provided that adequate data is available.

#### Organizational Structure
There are two primary models for organizing data science resources within a company:

Distributed setups integrate data science into existing business units such as business analytics, business intelligence, or IT teams. These units are typically found within different functions across the organization.
Capability-centric setups, on the other hand, feature a centralized data science capability that can be accessed by various functions across the company.
While distributed setups follow a traditional business structure with support capabilities focused on specific functions, capability-centric setups emphasize centralizing data science resources to optimize their impact on various business functions. Hybrid models combining elements of both approaches exist, but they will not be discussed further in this document.

Capability-centric models offer several advantages over distributed models, although they require greater effort to establish successfully. More decision-makers may be involved, potentially leading to significant delays and high opportunity costs. Additionally, capability-centric setups are more challenging to grow organically, which may be problematic in risk-averse environments. Nevertheless, the long-term benefits of capability-centric models often outweigh the initial challenges. Many organizations that eventually adopt a capability-centric approach to data science initially follow a different strategy.

### Capability-Centricity
Several factors must be carefully considered when implementing a data science capability. This section will describe three key factors that favor a capability-centric setup over a distributed one.
#### Agility
Data science thrives in agile environments, where prototyping, rapid iteration, and research are essential components. Scientific problem-solving drives the quality of data science project outcomes but requires significant flexibility and adaptability.

In corporate settings, projects are always subject to constraints, such as limited financial resources, time, or data availability. To prevent these constraints from becoming insurmountable, a supportive and enabling environment is necessary.

Capability-centric setups can achieve near-academic levels of agility by insulating data science from rigid corporate networks and surrounding business processes. Similar agile environments exist in startups, which is why "garage setups" often excel in data science. In distributed setups, data scientists are typically integrated into larger pre-existing teams and are thus subject to the same business processes as the rest of the team. This reduces the agility of the data scientist's work environment and ultimately their ability to succeed.

#### Synergy
In capability-centric setups, project knowledge can be more easily accumulated and shared among data scientists. Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of a company's data landscape can be developed by working across functions. Centralizing knowledge can enable powerful synergistic effects that are lost in distributed setups, where knowledge remains fragmented.

Numerous successful data science projects reported in the media have been facilitated by this effect. For instance, a team working on a sales project one month and a finance project the next may discover that customer insights and market elasticity data from the sales project can be applied to improve decision-making for financial investments across the company's product portfolio.

#### Talent and Scalability
High-quality talent is essential for data science but remains a scarce resource. Recent studies suggest that data science talent typically stays with a company for two to three years before seeking new opportunities. Measures to extend this period by increasing job attractiveness should be explored.

Centralizing talent allows data scientists to grow and collaborate with their peers, ultimately enhancing the company's capabilities. A capability-centric setup also provides more diverse career development opportunities due to the larger team size and a broader range of seniority levels. A centralized team can create an attractive work environment for data scientists, whereas distributed setups may lead to isolation and frustration.

Moreover, distributed setups risk relegating data science talent to mere analytical support roles, significantly limiting their potential.

Finally, capability-centric setups can often be scaled more easily than distributed ones, enabling support from external partners to adapt to fluctuating internal demand.

### Capability-Centric Models
One specific collaboration model for a capability-centric setup is an internal consulting approach. In this model, a central data science capability engages on a project basis with functions across a potentially global corporate environment. A consulting setup can serve as a powerful internal driver for leveraging data and scientific problem-solving for informed decision-making.
Another example of a capability-centric model is a garage setup, which emphasizes establishing an agile, fast-paced environment by deliberately situating data science outside of the corporate setting.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for incorporating data science capabilities in corporate environments. Existing structures and processes must be carefully examined to identify the optimal setup for each organization individually. The roles of people and mindsets should also be taken into account.
